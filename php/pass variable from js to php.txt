PHP is server side language and JS is client side.best way to do this is create a cookie using javascript and then read that cookie in PHP

<script type="text/javascript">
    document.cookie = "myJavascriptVar =12345";
</script>

<?php 
   $phpVar =  $_COOKIE['myJavascriptVar'];

   echo $phpVar;
?>
